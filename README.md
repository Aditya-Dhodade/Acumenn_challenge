# Acumenn_challenge
This model works with LSTM which uses its previous closing and opening stock value. The ipynb file shows predicted graph of stock for the next thirty days from which we cant take a call to when to buy and sell it. Although it does not consider various factors like companies financial performnce ,etc
Acumen challenge.ipynb contains lstm model for stock prediction.
Acumen_model_training.ipynb contains random forest classifier model which predict whether to buy or not using economic indicator like rsi, ema50, ema200, macd.
Backtest_aapl.ipynb contains total capital after investing 100000 in aapl stock in year 2000 which done by backtesting with the strategy implemented in above file.
